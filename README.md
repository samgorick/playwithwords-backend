# Play With Words
Fun and addictive word game - create as many valid words as you can in 2 minutes! I built this project to learn more about game development, animations and validation.

[Live demo](https://play-with-words-samgorick.netlify.app/)

## Features
- Play a new game with random letters, challenge a global highscore (using the same letters) or replay one of your previous games
- Guesses are validated based on (1) valid word in English dictionary (2) only uses unique letters in random set and (3) not previously guessed
- Letters are highlighted for the user in real-time as they are selected
- Audio and visual feedback based on correct/incorrect guesses

## Technologies
- Single Page Application built with vanilla Javascript and all styled with vanilla CSS
- [GSAP 3](https://greensock.com/gsap/) Javascript library used for animations
- Audio files stored client-side
- Dictionary regex file used for checking valid words and stored client-side
